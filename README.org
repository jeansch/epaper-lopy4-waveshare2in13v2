#+TITLE: Playing with e-paper and Micropython

I wanted to do some proof of concept using a Pycom LoPy4 and a e-paper display (epd2in13_V2).

* Hardware

- [[https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/2.13inch_e-Paper_HAT][Waveshare e-Paper V2]] (V2 is important here)
- [[https://pycom.io/product/lopy4/][Pycom LoPy4]] (running stock micropython from pycom)

* Software

-  [[https://github.com/waveshare/e-Paper/][Waveshare Python driver]] with my [[https://github.com/waveshare/e-Paper/pull/139][pull request]] for the MicroPython driver

* Testing

The MicroPython provided by pycom does not have the PIL (or Pillow) package.
So to run my test I crafted the "image" to display outside the controller (on my computer)
and just imported the generated python code.

** Get and upload the image.py

- Run /gen_image.py/ with the /2in13-v2.bmp/ test file from the Waveshare repository.
- Upload /image.py/ in /flash/

** Upload the driver from Waveshare (with my PR to get MicroPython implementation)

Following files goest to /flash/lib/waveshare_epd/ (to be created before)

- waveshare_epd/epd2in13_V2.py
- waveshare_epd/epd2in13_V2.py
- waveshare_epd/__init__.py

** Upload the main.py

In /flash/main.py

#+begin_example python
from waveshare_epd import epd2in13_V2
from image import image

epd = epd2in13_V2.EPD()
epd.init(epd.FULL_UPDATE)
epd.Clear(0xFF)
epd.display(image)
#+end_example
